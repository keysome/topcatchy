The tone and style of your content, including blog posts, marketing material and slogans, needs to be appropriate for the type of business you are running.

The tone and style of your content should also be consistent across all of your business activities and online platforms, including your blogs, social media accounts and email marketing messages. Developing a consistent voice is a crucial part of building trust with your audience. 

The words and language you use can also make a huge difference to public perception of your company. Think carefully about the words used in your slogans, marketing material and even the names of your products and services. Avoid words that could be misread, misconstrued or seen as offensive. Use plain words and simple language, wherever posÂ§ble, as jargon and convoluted language can be off-putting for many customers. Regardless of the voice and tone used in your business communications, it's important to check that all of your-content is free from spelling mistakes, poor grammar and other problems.
