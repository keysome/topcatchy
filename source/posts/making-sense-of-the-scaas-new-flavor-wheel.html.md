## Why Build a Personal Brand? 

When you're starting a business around your domain of expertise, the concept of developing a personal brand comes naturally. If you're the face of the business, building a personal brand makes sense. It's you who differentiates from the competition and helps you form a strong impression in your customers' and audience's mind. 

If your personal brand doesn't attract your target audience, it'll be difficult to create a sustainable and profitable business. Even if your company has a corporate brand it's still beneficial to build a personal brand. That's because people follow other people rather than company brands. So, your personal brand will increase your company's exposure. 

## Benefits

It's your chance to connect with your target audience. A personal brand will help you build trust with your prospects. It'll position you as a thought leader and authority in your business sector. 

A strong personal brand will make it easier for you to pitch and be discovered by media outlets such as online publications, television, podcasts and magazines.

When you have a clear personal brand, which reflects who you are and how you can help, it's easier for people to identify the value of following and connecting with you. Build your online and offline network effectively through your personal brand. 

## Your business will grow and evolve. 

You may venture into different industriesthroughout your career. But your personal brand must stay with you as your business evolves. People trust a brand, which connects to a person's face as compared to a corporate brand. 

Developing a personal brand will help you become the go-to source in a specific niche. This way, you'll attract more customers. When you're seen as an expert, people can easily refer clients to you.

## Start Creating a Compelling Personal Brand 

The first step to developing a personal brand isto set a foundation that you can confidently build upon. The key is authenticity. A personal brand doesn't mean creating a persona. A persona is a facade, not a true expression of who you are. Branding is about strategically and intentionally showcasing your true self to your target audience and customers. It must showcase your skills, values, passions, and beliefs. 

Define your message, the media and methods, through which you'll communicate your personal brand. And determine how you can monetize it. A personal brand doesn't necessarily mean that you must be an author, launch courses or run a mastermind even.
